# Java-Artificial-Feedforward-Neural-Network
All the classes generate a dense, feedforward neural network in Java. There is currently support for two loss functions, four optimizers,
and eight activation functions. All the optimizers are gradient descent based, though particle swarm is a feature I would like to implement in the future. 
Currently I do not have plans to write the Nesterov variants of each optimizer. See the "example" program to see how to implement this program on an example 
training set. 

Future commits:
- Additional loss functions (in particular, Binary Cross Entropy and Hubert)
- RMSProp gradient descent algorithm
- Particle swarm optimization algorithm.
